## SVM classifier using R and Tableau
In this project, I trained an SVM model to classify donors (By making a buy) and to answer the question "How likely would a donor donate the next time?" based on his/her Age and Income.
I used R for that task, trained the model and when I came to a solution, I integrated R with Tableau to benefit from its powerful visuals, connecting both on an external server.
